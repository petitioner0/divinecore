 **Current Version:** Alpha (testing stage)

This is a **core mod designed to serve an integration pack**, providing essential gameplay logic and framework support.  
It is **not a standalone mod** â€” playing it alone will not offer a complete experience. Please look up the modpack coming late: **God's twenty-one edicts**

The current version is in **Alpha**, which means there may be many bugs or unfinished features.  
Testing and feedback are greatly appreciated!

## For Players


If you are a player, it is **strongly recommended not to read the source code in detail**.  

The integration pack relies heavily on secrets and discovery; reading the code **may lead to major spoilers**.

If you encounter any bugs, crashes, or inconsistencies, please submit them in the **Issues**
